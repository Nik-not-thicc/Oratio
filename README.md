## Blazor Server App with MudBlazor (.NET 9.0)

This is a Blazor Server application built with **.NET 9.0** and styled using the powerful **MudBlazor** component library.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/rider/download) or [Visual Studio 2022/2025](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with **ASP.NET and web development** workload
- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) (sometimes comes with the IDE, or IDE asks to install SDK on opening the project)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nik-not-thicc/Oratio.git
```

### 2. Open the project

In your IDE select the option to open a project and then selcet the BlazorApp1.sln file. This will open the project for you.

### 3. Restore Nuget Packages

Rider takes care of this step on it's own, i do not know if Visual Studio does so too.
In the IDEs terminal navigate to the projects root and run

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 4. Run the app

Press the run button.
